  dialogue:
  - Ho... ho... ho... Hello young man!
  - You may wonder why you are here.
  - Well... You are the chosen one. Don't worry, you can still go back after you
    have completed all the challenges and proved yourself.
  - You know, nowadays every man has to be strong, smart and ambitous.
  - First of all, face every challenge and walk the path toward success with unwavering
    resolve. (Defeat enemies in dungeon)
  - Secondly, push the stone, heavy and unyielding, until it rests where three pillars
    stand. (Push the block to the platform between three pillars)
  - Lastly, climb to the highest point, where the sky kisses the earth. It is a testament
    to the ambition that drives every soul. (Interact with the statue)
  - Now go and prove yourself, young man. Show that you are strong of body, wise
    of mind, and driven by ambition!
